# Included in the hw4 folder, you will find the "cancer.csv" dataset which
# contains the following variables:
# ID: patient id number
# TRT: patient treatment group (0=control, 1=treatment)
# AGE: patients age in years
# WEIGHIN: patients weight at the beginning of the study
# STAGE: inital cancer stage
# TOTALCIN: initail oral condition
# TOTALCW2: oral condition at week 2
# TOTALCW4: oral condition at week 4
# TOTALCW6: oral condition at week 6

# Produce a plot of densities for patien age broken down by group. Color
# the treatment group red and the control group black. Label the x-axis
# "age". Give your plot the title "Patient age by group". Set the range of
# your x-axis to be 20, 100. You will need to read in the data to do this.

# Load in the "babies.csv" dataset for this problem. Implement the function

# <group1.idcs>: a numeric vector giving the indices of some subset of
#   <data>
# <group2.idcs>: a numeric vector giving the indices of some other subset
#   of <data>. NOTE: the two idcs vectors should contain no overlapping
#   elements.
# <test.alternative>: a character string equal to one of the following
#   c("two.sided, "less", "greater") specifying the directionalty of the t.test
#
# Your function should return the following output:
#
# <t.test.output> the entire output of the t.test comparing gestation
#   period for the two given groups. Use the group1 subset the first
#   argument, group 2 as the second argument and the alternative direction
